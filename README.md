# sslGenerator
A script to generate ssl certificates, asks for user input and generates ca.pem server.pem and client.pem files that can be used with local mongodb clients.

This is my first bash script, it works, i have tested it with multiple ca, server and client files.

I made this because some of the other scripts that I had tried to use before were giving me self signed certificate errors when
I was trying to connect to mongodb with them. 

The code is far from perfect, so feel free to give me pointers on how to improve it

Thanks!
